# screenshottigans
Screenshot Shenanigans - Scripts written for making screenshots of things like Telnet, RDP, VNC.  
All largely written in Bash, because reasons.  
See the notes below for each tool. This repo is going to undergo a lot of changes/updates, and probably will never reach a stable release, so caveat emptor.
